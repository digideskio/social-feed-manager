__THIS IS NOT THE SFM YOU SEEK__. (Well, probably not.) This is the original
version of Social Feed Manager. For the new version, see [go.gwu.edu/sfm](http://go.gwu.edu/sfm).


social feed manager
===================

A django application for managing multiple feeds of social media data.

Historical Publications and Records Commission (NHPRC), Innovation Grant

Current status
--------------

We're only addressing bugs in this version of SFM. However, we're actively
developing the [new version](http://go.gwu.edu/sfm) of SFM with similar and extended functionality.

Documentation
-------------

A growing set of documentation is available under the docs/ directory,
available also online:

  http://social-feed-manager.readthedocs.org/

We encourage you to read the Introduction before implementing this app.
Maintaining growing feeds of social media data takes some planning
and system adminstration experience.  The Introduction should help you
prepare for this.


Development
-----------

To work on sfm, clone/fork it in github.  If you send pull requests from
a fork, please make them as atomic as you can.

We are actively working on this, making changes in response to university
researcher requests.  If the features it supports seem fickle and spotty
it's because we're still just getting started and still figuring out
what we need it to do.  Please get in touch and tell us what you think.
