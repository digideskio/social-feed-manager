Using Supervisord to Manage Streaming Filters
=============================================

Social Feed Manager uses `supervisord <http://supervisord.org/>`_ to manage
the filterstream and streamsample processes.  As streaming processes,
these are intended to be run on a continuous, ongoing basis, to collect
tweets over time.  Supervisord is a process control system that, among
other features, manages the SFM streaming processes independently from the
SFM web application, and can restart these processes if they fail or after
a system reboot.

Twitterfilters and/or streamsample *can* still be run independently of
supervisord if desired (e.g. for testing), by invoking them at the command
line as :doc:`management commands </mgmt_commands>`.

Supervisor setup
----------------

Supervisord is installed as part of the standard SFM installation; it is
one of SFM's ubuntu package dependencies.  However, it must be configured
in order to use filterstreams.

Configuring the supervisor process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To configure supervisord for SFM:

Edit ``/etc/supervisor/supervisord.conf``:

     In the ``[unix_http_server]`` section, add ``chown=www-data:www-data`` so that the socket file will be created with www-data as the owner (apache runs as the www-data user)
     
     In the ``[include]`` section (in a new instance of supervisor, this is usually at the bottom) add ``supervisor.d/*.conf`` to the space-separated list of ``files``:
   
       ``files = /etc/supervisor/conf.d/*.conf <PATH_TO_YOUR_SFM>/sfm/sfm/supervisor.d/*.conf``

NOTE:  If you wish to modify (add/enable/remove/disable) filterstreams when
running the app with django "runserver" rather than apache, you will need to
ensure that the supervisor socket file has 777 permissions.  After the ``chown=www-data:www-data`` line in supervisord.conf, modify the default ``chmod=700``
line to ``chmod=777``.

Configuring the www-data system group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next we will create a ``www-data`` group and add your user to it:

.. code-block:: none

     $ sudo vi /etc/group

You should see a line that looks something like this:

       ``www-data:x:<a group number>:``

add your own user to this group:

       ``www-data:x:<a group number>:<your user name>``

Setting up the log directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next, create a ``/var/log/sfm`` directory. The supervisor-supervised processes will write log files to this directory.

.. code-block:: none

        $ sudo mkdir /var/log/sfm

Change the directory group ownership to ``www-data``:

.. code-block:: none

        $ sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/log/sfm

Edit local_settings.py to set SUPERVISOR\_PROCESS\_OWNER to a user
who has rights to write to ``/var/log/sfm`` (such as your user).

Setting up the data directory for stream output
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Edit local_settings.py to set DATA\_DIR to the directory where you
want stream output stored.  Change its ownership to ``www-data:www-data``:

.. code-block:: none

        $ sudo chown www-data:www-data <YOUR DATA DIRECTORY>

Setting ownership of sfm/sfm/supervisor.d
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Set ownership of the ``sfm/sfm/supervisor.d`` directory to www-data:www-data
allow the apache user (www-data) to write to it. 

.. code-block:: none

   $ sudo chown www-data:www-data sfm/sfm/supervisor.d

Optional configurations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may also wish to adjust SAVE\_INTERVAL\_SETTINGS, which controls
how often sfm will save data to a new file (default is every 15 minutes,
specified in ``settings.py``).

Restarting supervisor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Finally, restart supervisor:

.. code-block:: none

     $ sudo service supervisor stop
     $ sudo service supervisor start


Streamsample setup
------------------

A template streamsample configuration file "streamsample.conf.template" is
included in the SFM distribution.  To set up a streamsample process managed by
supervisor:

Browse to the supervisord.d directory and copy streamsample.conf.template
to streamsample.conf

.. code-block:: none

   $ cd sfm/sfm/supervisor.d
   $ cp streamsample.conf.template streamsample.conf

Edit streamsample.conf to use the path to your sfm project, the value of the PATH environment variable set within your virtualenv, and to use your preferred system user account (to avoid having the output files owned by root).

To have supervisor refresh its list of configuration files and start the
streamsample process, first run supervisorctl:

.. code-block:: none
   
     $ sudo supervisorctl

If you don't see a line that reads something like:

       streamsample                     RUNNING    pid 889, uptime 21:45:25

then at the supervisor prompt, run 'update' to reload the config files:

.. code-block:: none

     $ supervisor> update

Running update should result in the following message:

       streamsample: added process group

Now verify that streamsample has been started by viewing the status of
the processes:

.. code-block:: none

     $ supervisor> status

This should result in a list of processes which includes streamsample,
for example:

       streamsample                     RUNNING    pid 889, uptime 21:45:25

To stop the streamsample process, run supervisorctl and use the command

.. code-block:: none

     $ supervisor> stop streamsample



Filterstream setup
------------------

TwitterFilters in SFM are intended to create filterstream Twitter processes.

While streamsample must be started and stopped using supervisorctl,
supervisor's management of TwitterFilter processes is mediated by the SFM
application.

SFM creates configuration files for filterstream processes when an administrative
user adds new TwitterFilters in SFM.  The files are created in the
sfm/sfm/supervisor.d directory.  SFM takes care of updating supervisor so that
it starts the new filterstream process.

If an administrative user modifies an existing, active TwitterFilter, SFM
deletes the old configuration file for that TwitterFilter's filterstream
process, writes a new configuration file containing the TwitterFilter's updated
parameters, and restarts the filterstream process.

If an administrative user deactivates or deletes a TwitterFilter, SFM
deletes the configuration file for that TwitterFilter's filterstream process,
and stops the filterstream process.


OAuth constraints
-----------------

To avoid triggering the Twitter API's rate limiting constraints, every
SFM streaming connection must use a different set of Twitter credentials.
SFM does not allow active filterstreams to run using the same Twitter
credentials as streamsample, or as any other active filterstream.

The streamsample process connects to the Twitter API using the
TWITTER_DEFAULT_USERNAME set in local_settings.py.  Each Filterstream process
connects to the Twitter API using the User configured in its TwitterFilter.
