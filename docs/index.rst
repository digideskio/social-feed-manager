Welcome to Social Feed Manager!
===============================

Social Feed Manager is a Django application developed by George Washington University Libraries to collect social media data from Twitter. It connects to Twitter's approved API to collect data in bulk and makes it possible for scholars, students, and librarians to identify, select, collect, and preserve Twitter data for research purposes. 

The application code is open source and `available on github`_.

.. _available on github: http://github.com/gwu-libraries/social-feed-manager/ 

We are in the process of re-architecting Social Feed Manager. For updates, see the `sfm-ui repo on github`_ and the project scope and background in its `wiki`_. When documentation for the new app is available, we will point to that from here.
